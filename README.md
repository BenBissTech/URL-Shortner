# URL-Shortner
 Web application to shorten provided URLs
 
 Packages:

 Bootstrap - prewritten CSS framework (stylises webpage)
 React-bootstrap - bootstrap for react
 Nanoid - generates unique identifier which will append to the generated shortened URL
 React-router-dom - handles routen for the webpages of the application
 Firebase - stores the data for the application
 Valid-url - tells us if provided URL by user is valid

To solve Switch import failure
    npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0
or use Routes instead of Switch

npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
